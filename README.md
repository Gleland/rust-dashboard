I was inspired by [homer-dashboard](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) and wanted to learn some rust along the way. This is not (and should not be) used for anything other than personal tinkering.


### Usage

Start the application with:

```bash
cargo run
```

and vist `localhost:8080` in your browser.
